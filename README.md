# Doc2Doc-Comparison-using-Word2Vec-Model
Deep Learning Project [UCSC Silicon Valley Extension: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow]

## Project Overview
### Project Description
Evaluate 10 supervised learning algorithms that are currently available in scikit-learn on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 

### Project Procedure
- Explore the data
- Preprocesse the data
- Evaluate performance of several supervised learning algorithms
- Choose the best model
- Tune model parameters using grid search
- Evaluate feature importance to optimize the model's performance

### Project Results

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
